/// - notSignedIn: Indicates the API failed because the user is not signed-in.
/// - authTokenMissing: Thrown when required authentication tokens were not returned by Secure Vault service.
/// - serviceError: Indicates that an internal server error occurred. Retrying at a later time may succeed.
/// - fatalError: Indicates that a fatal error occurred. This could be due to
///     coding error, out-of-memory condition or other conditions that is
///     beyond control of `IdentityProvider` implementation.
