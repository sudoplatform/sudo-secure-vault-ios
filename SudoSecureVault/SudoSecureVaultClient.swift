///
/// - alreadyRegistered: Thrown when attempting to register but the client is already registered.
/// - registerOperationAlreadyInProgress: Thrown when duplicate register calls are made.
/// - notRegistered: Indicates the client has not been registered to the
///     Sudo platform backend.
/// - notSignedIn: Indicates the API being called requires the client to sign in.
/// - notSignedIn: Indicates the API being called requires the client to sign in.
/// - invalidOwnershipProofError: Indicates the ownership proof provided for the new vault was invalid.
/// - authTokenMissing: Thrown when required authentication tokens were not return by Secure Vault service.
/// - versionMismatch: Indicates the version of the vault that is getting updated does not match
///     the current version of the vault stored in the backend. The caller should retrieve the
///     current version of the vault and reconcile the difference..
/// - notAuthorized: Indicates the authentication failed. Likely due to incorrect private key, the identity
///     being removed from the backend or significant clock skew between the client and the backend.
/// - invalidInput: Indicates the input to the API was invalid.
/// - insufficientEntitlements: Operation failed due to the user not having sufficient entitlements.
/// - serviceError: Indicates that an internal server error caused the operation to fail. The error is
///     possibly transient and retrying at a later time may cause the operation to complete
///     successfully
/// - graphQLError: Indicates that a GraphQL error was returned by the backend.
/// - fatalError: Indicates that a fatal error occurred. This could be due to
///     coding error, out-of-memory condition or other conditions that is
///     beyond control of `SudoSecureVaultClient` implementation.
